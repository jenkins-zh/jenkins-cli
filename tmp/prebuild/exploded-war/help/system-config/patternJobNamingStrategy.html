<div>
  Define a pattern (regular expression) to check whether or not the job name is valid.
  <p>
  Forcing the check on existing jobs, will allow you to enforce a naming convention on existing jobs - e.g. even if the user does not change the name, 
  it will be validated with the given pattern at every submit and no updates can be made until the name conforms.<br>
  <i>This option does not affect the execution of jobs with non-compliant names.
  It just controls the validation process when saving job configurations.</i>
