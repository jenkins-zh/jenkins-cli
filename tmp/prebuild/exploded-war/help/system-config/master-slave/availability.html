        <dd>
            In this mode, Jenkins will keep this agent online as much as
            possible.
            <p>
            If the agent goes offline, e.g. due to a temporary network failure,
            Jenkins will periodically attempt to restart it.

        <dt><b>
            Bring this agent online according to a schedule

        <dd>
            In this mode, Jenkins will bring this agent online at the scheduled
            time(s), remaining online for a specified amount of time.

            If the agent goes offline while it is scheduled to be online,
            Jenkins will periodically attempt to restart it.
            <p>
            After this agent has been online for the number of minutes specified
            in the <i>Scheduled Uptime</i> field, it will be taken offline.
            <br>
            If <i>Keep online while builds are running</i> is checked, and the
            agent is scheduled to be taken offline, Jenkins will wait for
            any builds that may be in progress to complete.

        <dt><b>
            Bring this agent online when in demand, and take offline when idle

        <dd>
            In this mode, Jenkins will bring this agent online if there
            is demand, i.e. there are queued builds which meet the following
            criteria:
            <ul>
                <li>They have been in the queue for at least the specified <i>In
                    demand delay</i> time period</li>
                <li>They can be executed by this agent (e.g. have a matching
                    label expression)</li>
            </ul>

            This agent will be taken offline if:
            <ul>
                <li>There are no active builds running on this agent</li>
                <li>This agent has been idle for at least the specified <i>Idle
