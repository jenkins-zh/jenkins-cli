  Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds
  by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for scripts).
  <p>One typical example
  for this feature would be to trigger new build from the source
  control system's hook script, when somebody has just committed
  a change into the repository, or from a script that parses
  your source control email notifications.</p>
  <p>You'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of
  a string so that only those who know it would be able to remotely
  trigger this project's builds.</p>
  <p>This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants read access to this job to anonymous users.</p>
  <p>When that's not the case, Jenkins will reject requests sent to the trigger URL even when the correct token is specified.</p>
  <p>To solve this, the HTTP requests needs to be authenticated as a user with the necessary read permission for the job &mdash; but then you could probably just grant this user the permission to build this anyway.</p>
  <p>Another option is to use the Build Token Root Plugin, that provides additional URL endpoints to trigger builds using this token, and doesn't require the otherwise necessary Overall/Read and Job/Read permissions to do so.</p>
