  If this option is enabled, all of <a href="lastSuccessfulBuild/fingerprint">
  the builds that are referenced</a> from builds of this project (via fingerprint)
  will be protected from log rotation.

  <p>
  When your job depends on other jobs on Jenkins and you occasionally need
  to tag your workspace, it's often convenient/necessary to also tag your
  dependencies on Jenkins. The problem is that the log rotation could
  interfere with this, since the build your project is using might already be
  log rotated (if there have been a lot of builds in your dependency), and
  if that happens you won't be able to reliably tag your dependencies.

  <p>
  This feature fixes that problem by "locking" those builds that you depend on,
  thereby guaranteeing that you can always tag your complete dependencies.
