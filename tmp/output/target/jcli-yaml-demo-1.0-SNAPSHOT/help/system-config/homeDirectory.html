  <p>By default, Jenkins stores all of its data in this directory on the file
    system.</p>
  <p>
  There are a few ways to change the Jenkins home directory:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Edit the <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> variable in your Jenkins configuration
      file (e.g. <code>/etc/sysconfig/jenkins</code> on Red Hat Linux).
    <li>
      Use your web container's admin tool to set the <code>JENKINS_HOME</code>
      environment variable.
    <li>
      Set the environment variable <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> before launching
      your web container, or before launching Jenkins directly from the WAR file.
    <li>
      Set the <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> Java system property when launching your
      web container, or when launching Jenkins directly from the WAR file.
    <li>
      Modify <tt>web.xml</tt> in <tt>jenkins.war</tt> (or its expanded image in
      your web container). This is not recommended.
  </ul>
  This value cannot be changed while Jenkins is running.
