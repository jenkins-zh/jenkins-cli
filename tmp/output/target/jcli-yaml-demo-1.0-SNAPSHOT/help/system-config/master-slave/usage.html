<div>
  Controls how Jenkins schedules builds on this node.

  <dl>
    <dt><b>
      Use this node as much as possible
    </b></dt>
    <dd>
      This is the default setting.
      <br>
      In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build
      that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>
      Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node
    </b></dt>
    <dd>
      In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this node when
      that project is restricted to certain nodes using a label expression,
      and that expression matches this node&apos;s name and/or labels.
      <p>
      This allows a node to be reserved for certain kinds of jobs.
      For example, if you have jobs that run performance tests, you may want
      them to only run on a specially configured machine, while preventing all
      other jobs from using that machine. To do so, you would restrict where the
      test jobs may run by giving them a label expression matching that machine.
      <br>
      Furthermore, if you set the <i># of executors</i> value to 1, you
      can ensure that only one performance test will execute at any given time
      on that machine; no other builds will interfere.
