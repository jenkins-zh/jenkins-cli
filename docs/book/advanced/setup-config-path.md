# Setup config file

In some cases, you might want to give it a specific configuration path instead of the default one. You can do it by add an environment variable `JCLI_CONFIG`.

For example, put the following config into your shell profile:

```text
JCLI_CONFIG=/var/yourPath/jenkins-cli.yaml
```
